## Features

- **Drag & drop** audio or video files — or click to open a file picker
- **Batch processing** — queue multiple files and transcribe in one run
- **100% local** — runs `openai-whisper` on your own machine; nothing leaves your device
- **Model selector** — `tiny` → `large-v3` to trade speed for accuracy
- **Language selector** — auto-detect, or pin to Chinese, English, Japanese, or Korean
- **Transcript per file** — saved next to the source as `filename.逐字稿.txt`
- **Self-contained installer** — bundles the .NET 8 runtime; no pre-install needed

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Windows | 10 / 11 (64-bit) | |
| Python | 3.10 or later | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — add to PATH during install |
| openai-whisper | latest | `pip install openai-whisper` |
| ffmpeg | any | `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` or [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) |

> The installer can handle the Whisper + ffmpeg step automatically — see [Installation](#installation).

---

## Installation

### Option A — Download the installer (recommended)

1. Go to the [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) page and download `WhisperApp-Setup.exe`.
2. Run the installer. On the **Select Additional Tasks** screen:
   - Tick **"建立桌面捷徑"** if you want a desktop shortcut.
   - Tick **"安裝 Whisper 相依套件"** to automatically install `openai-whisper` and `ffmpeg` (Python must already be on PATH).
3. Click **Install**, then launch WhisperApp from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

> If you skipped step 2, install the dependencies manually:
> ```powershell
> # In a terminal (Python must be on PATH)
> pip install openai-whisper
> winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
> ```

### Option B — Run from source

See [Development](#development) below.

## Usage

1. **Add files** — drag audio/video onto the drop zone, or click it to open a file picker.  
   Supported: `mp3` `wav` `m4a` `aac` `flac` `ogg` `wma` `mp4` `mov` `mkv` `avi` `webm`

2. **Pick a model** — left dropdown. Larger models are slower but more accurate.

   | Model | Speed | Best for |
   |-------|-------|----------|
   | `tiny` | ~10× realtime | Quick drafts, clear speech |
   | `base` | ~7× realtime | General use |
   | `small` | ~4× realtime | Better accuracy |
   | `medium` | ~2× realtime | High accuracy |
   | `large-v3` | ~1× realtime | Best quality |

   The first run for a new model downloads its weights to `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\whisper`. Later runs reuse the cached weights offline.

3. **Pick a language** — right dropdown, or leave on **自動偵測** to let Whisper detect it.

4. Click **開始轉錄**. Progress and live log output appear as each file is processed.

5. When a file completes, click **下載 txt** to save the transcript anywhere, or find it automatically next to the source file:
   ```
   C:\Videos\meeting.mp4
   C:\Videos\meeting.逐字稿.txt   ← created by WhisperApp
   ```

6. Click **清除完成項目** to remove finished entries from the queue.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8) (includes the `dotnet` CLI)
- Any editor — [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Community is free), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or VS Code with the C# Dev Kit

### Clone and run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/KaiYin77/whisper-app.git
cd whisper-app/WhisperApp
dotnet run
```

### Common commands

```powershell
# Run in development (hot-reload not supported for WPF, just restart)
dotnet run

# Build only (no launch)
dotnet build

# Run tests (none yet — add under WhisperApp.Tests/)
dotnet test

# Publish self-contained binary for Windows x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

### Building the installer

Requires [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (free download).

```powershell
# From the WhisperApp/ directory — publishes the app then compiles the installer
.\build-installer.ps1
# Output: dist\WhisperApp-Setup.exe
```

### Releasing a new version

Push a version tag — GitHub Actions builds and publishes the installer to GitHub Releases automatically:

```powershell
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs on `windows-latest`, installs Inno Setup via Chocolatey, runs `build-installer.ps1`, and attaches `WhisperApp-Setup.exe` to the release with auto-generated release notes.

### Project structure

```

    └── app-icon.ico             # Window / taskbar / installer icon
```

### How Whisper is invoked

The app auto-discovers the Whisper CLI — no configuration needed. It checks in this order:

1. `whisper.exe`
2. `whisper`
3. `py -3.12 -m whisper`
4. `python -m whisper`

The resolved command is called with the selected file path, model, language, output format (`txt`), and output directory. stdout and stderr are streamed live to the log panel.

Pull requests are welcome. For significant changes, please open an issue first to align on the approach before writing code.
