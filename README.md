## Features

- **Drag & drop** audio or video files — or click to open a file picker
- **Batch processing** — queue multiple files and transcribe in one run
- **100% local** — Whisper runs entirely on your machine; nothing leaves your device
- **Model selector** — `tiny` → `large-v3` to trade speed for accuracy; models are downloaded once and cached
- **Language selector** — auto-detect, or pin to Chinese, English, Japanese, or Korean
- **Timecoded transcript** — each line is prefixed with `[hh:mm:ss]`
- **Traditional Chinese output** — transcript is automatically converted to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
- **Transcript per file** — saved next to the source as `filename-逐字稿.txt`
- **Zero external dependencies** — powered by [Whisper.net](https://github.com/sandrohanea/whisper.net) + [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio); no Python or ffmpeg required
- **Self-contained installer** — bundles the .NET 8 runtime; no pre-install needed

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit) | Uses Windows Media Foundation for audio decoding — no extra install needed |
| macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon or Intel) | Requires `ffmpeg`: `brew install ffmpeg` |
| Internet connection (first run only) | To download the selected Whisper model (~75 MB–3 GB depending on model) |

No Python required on either platform.

---

## Installation

### Option A — Download the installer (recommended)

**Windows** — download `WhisperApp-Setup.exe` from the [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) page, run it, and launch from the Start Menu.

**macOS** — download the zip for your chip (`macOS-Apple-Silicon` for M1/M2/M3, `macOS-Intel` for older Macs) from the [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) page. Unzip, then run the binary. You also need ffmpeg installed once:
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Option B — Run from source

See [Development](#development) below.

## Usage

1. **Add files** — drag audio/video onto the drop zone, or click it to open a file picker.  
   Supported: `mp3` `wav` `m4a` `aac` `flac` `ogg` `wma` `mp4` `mov` `mkv` `avi` `webm`

2. **Pick a model** — left dropdown. Larger models are slower but more accurate.

   | Model | Best for |
   |-------|----------|
   | `tiny` | Quick drafts, clear speech |
   | `base` | General use (default) |
   | `small` | Better accuracy |
   | `medium` | High accuracy |
   | `large-v3` | Best quality |

   The first time you use a model, its weights are downloaded automatically and cached to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperApp\models\`. Subsequent runs use the cached file offline.

3. **Pick a language** — right dropdown, or leave on **自動偵測** to let Whisper detect it.

4. Click **開始轉錄**. A progress bar tracks each file as segments are processed.

5. When a file completes, click **下載 txt** to save the transcript anywhere, or find it automatically next to the source file:
   ```
   C:\Videos\meeting.mp4
   C:\Videos\meeting-逐字稿.txt   ← created by WhisperApp
   ```
   Each line is timecoded:
   ```
   [00:00:03] 歡迎來到本次會議。
   [00:00:07] 今天我們要討論的主題是...
   ```

6. Click **清除完成項目** to remove finished entries from the queue.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8)
- Any editor — [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Community is free), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or VS Code with the C# Dev Kit

### Clone and run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/KaiYin77/whisper-desktop.git
cd whisper-desktop
dotnet run
```

### Common commands

```powershell
# Run in development
dotnet run

# Build only
dotnet build

# Publish self-contained binary for Windows x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

### Building the installer

Requires [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (free download).

```powershell
# Publishes the app then compiles the installer
.\build-installer.ps1
# Output: dist\WhisperApp-Setup.exe
```

### Releasing a new version

Push a version tag — GitHub Actions builds and publishes the installer to GitHub Releases automatically:

```powershell
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs on `windows-latest`, installs Inno Setup via Chocolatey, runs `build-installer.ps1`, and attaches `WhisperApp-Setup.exe` to the release with auto-generated release notes.
